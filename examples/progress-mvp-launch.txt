# DAO Domain - MVP Launch Progress

## Mission: Ship by Breakfast

**Goal:** Fix blockers, implement MVP features, deploy staging
**Timeline:** Tonight/early morning
**Pricing:** $19.99/year (competitive with Hostinger/Namecheap)

---

## Critical Blockers (Fix First)

### BLOCKER-001: Domains route crashes ❌
**Status:** NOT STARTED
**Error:** `TypeError: undefined is not an object (evaluating 'value[max > 10000 ? value[1] : value[1]].toLocaleString')`
**Location:** Search for this in app/api/domains/ or components with price range
**Fix:** Replace with `(value?.[1] ?? 0).toLocaleString('en-US')`
**Test:** npm run dev, visit /domains, use price range filter
**Blocker:** Site is broken until fixed

### BLOCKER-002: Security vulnerabilities (11 moderate, 1 high) ❌
**Status:** NOT STARTED
**Issues:** Next.js DoS, ajv ReDoS, eslint chain
**Fix:**
```bash
npm audit fix
npm install next@16.1.6
npm install ajv@latest --save-dev
npm audit  # Verify 0 high/critical
```
**Test:** npm run build
**Blocker:** Can't deploy with high/critical vulns
